#### Created as Final Project for ITP341 (Spring 2016)

This app aims to serve as an interface between the students who want to pursue their passion and can help other pursue their interests at the same time. 
A student, no matter what area of study he is pursuing, benefits a great deal from a mentor to help solve doubts, guide, instruct, and help learn from the challenges. The application targets two such groups of people, mentors and mentees.  The beauty of the project lies in the fact that the same person can act as both, mentor and mentee.

```
Example: 
Student A is good at playing guitar but doesnâ€™t know how to code.
Student B is good at coding, but wants to learn how to play a guitar.
The app will help the students connect to each other and both students can learn and guide the other person at the same time.
